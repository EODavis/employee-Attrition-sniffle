# Predict Employee Attrition and Retention with Machine Learning

This app helps organisations predict the likelihood of employee attrition based on key features such as job role, age, income, and more. Built using machine learning, this tool empowers HR teams to proactively identify employees at risk of leaving and take timely action to improve retention.

# Project Overview
Employee attrition (turnover) is a significant challenge for HR departments. By predicting which employees are at risk of leaving, companies can focus on improving retention strategies, reducing recruitment costs, and maintaining a stable workforce. This application uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict attrition with high accuracy, based on historical employee data.

# Key Features
Predict Employee Attrition: Given various employee attributes, the app will predict the likelihood of an employee leaving.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, categorical variables, and scales numerical features for optimal model performance.

Interactive Dashboard: Easily input employee data for real-time predictions with an intuitive user interface.

Model Explanation: Understand the model's prediction through feature importance and detailed feedback on why an employee might leave.

# Technologies Used
Streamlit: For the interactive web app interface.

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: Model training, evaluation, and scaling.

Matplotlib: Data visualisation for insights and model performance.

Random Forest Classifier: The ML model used for prediction.

Pickle: Model serialisation for easy deployment and reuse.

# How It Works
Upload Your Dataset: Start by uploading your companyâ€™s employee data. The app will automatically preprocess it (handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables).

Model Training: The app uses a trained Random Forest model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave or stay.

Real-time Prediction: Input new employee data, and get predictions instantly.

Actionable Insights: View feature importance to identify factors driving employee attrition and make data-backed decisions.
